# My Sunshine app

### Open Weather Map API Key is required.

In order for the Sunshine app to function properly an API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build.

You can obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://openweathermap.org/appid#use), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to 
[USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
